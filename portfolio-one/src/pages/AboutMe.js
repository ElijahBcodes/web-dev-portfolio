   <p className=''>About Me
I started my professional career with the Navy in the electronics field as a tech for the Mk-14 CIWS defense system. After leaving the Navy I worked in the Debt Collection Industry. In a management role there I began to build static web pages and was intrigued by the process of web development. Shortly after our first child I became a stay at home dad. Now I am transitioning into a career as a Web Developer. Tech is something I am passionate about because of the challenging nature of the ever changing field. I am a lifelong learner and have always enjoyed pushing myself to learn new concepts. When I am not with family or friends my personal hobbies include running trails, ultra-marathons, and fitness.
