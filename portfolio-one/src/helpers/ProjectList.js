As music lovers, our team decided to create a music application where you can find new songs based on what mood you're in. Users can create an account through the Ruby Devise gem and perform basic CRUD actions with songs. We've also implemented a media player so that when you find a song you want to listen to, you can listen to it right on our app! Click the pick to be taken to the app and view the repo on GitHub. ",
